### Improvements I'd make if I had time:

- Used TS
- Extracted config out to environment variables
- Wrote some tests, for sure
- Added eslint, prettier
- Added lint-staged
- Implemented some input validation
- Extracted queries in separate files for readability and reusability
- Used a framework instead of raw express


PS: I've never used sequilize before, and most of my work in the last couple of years was on pure engineering and system work so my sql queries are a bit rusty...
